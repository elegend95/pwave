# Anyons in p-wave superfluids

This codes perform the exact diagonalization of a two dimensiona p-wave superfluid with three different choices of discretization of the Hamiltonian. In each case the systems is supposed to be trapped in a hard wall circular potential.

## SquareLattice

The Hamiltonian is written on a square lattice.
